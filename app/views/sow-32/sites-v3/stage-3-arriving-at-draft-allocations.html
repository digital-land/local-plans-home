                      Identifying draft site allocations follows a similar process to Stage 2, but considers different things. While you focused on assessing and removing unsuitable sites in Stage 2, Stage 3 is where you select the sites that meet your planâ€™s vision. Itâ€™s essentially the next step in the same process, and often uses much of the same information, but needs more of your planning judgement. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to prioritise your local context, strategy and vision.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This stage is classed as â€˜policy onâ€™, and is where relevant national and development plan policies are applied.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Preparing potential draft site allocations may be an iterative process. Itâ€™s likely youâ€™ll revisit different stages, particularly following consultation and engagement with stakeholders. You'll refine your draft allocations, based on any new information you learn, as you do so.

                      Applying planning judgement

                    <p>
                      Local context is key to making decisions and is the most important element of drafting allocations. It includes the needs of your area, your vision for the plan and spatial strategy. The approach you take to site selection should also be consistent with existing national policy.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To arrive at draft site allocations, you should: 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>weigh your assessed sites against local need </li>
                      <li>consider what alternative approaches you may need to explore to meet this need </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      Where you need to, you can use the same methodology from Stage 2 to consider alternative approaches. For example, when considering <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/strategic-environmental-assessment-and-sustainability-appraisal#strategic-environmental-assessment-requirements-for-neighbourhood-plans:~:text=06%2003%202014-,Strategic%20environmental%20assessment%20requirements%20for%20neighbourhood%20plans,-Does%20a%20neighbourhood">environmental constraints</a>, reassessing will show you have considered the mitigation hierarchy required as part of an environmental assessment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It will also help you demonstrate how youâ€™ve selected sites appropriate for your local plan. Inspectors at examination want to understand the rationale of your decisions â€“ by showing your thinking and documenting your thinking, itâ€™s more likely to show that your approach is sound. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Your approach to selecting the right sites from Stage 2 will depend on several factors unique to your planâ€™s objectives. These include environmental, economic and social objectives. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You are best placed to make judgements based on these factors. The context of your plan area and local vision is most important when reaching decisions.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Here are some example factors you could consider (this list is not exhaustive):

                      Engaging your stakeholders
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>
                      As with all stages, you should engage with relevant stakeholders on any decisions while drafting your allocations. This includes people who responded to your call for sites, developers, and members of the local community. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This can include formal and less formal engagement done in the process of preparing your plan. Any such engagement should be available for review at the end of the process, so make sure to conduct it in an open way.  You should also have meaningful, ongoing and proportionate consultation with landowners, developers and promoters, particularly for large or strategic sites. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Wherever you take opportunities for engagement, where itâ€™s appropriate, you should respond to representations made or views shared on sites. You should record where representations have identified considerations that influence decisions on sites.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You will need to build in enough time between engagement on the draft site allocations and examination to be able to properly consider responses. You may also need to engage with elected members as per local governance arrangements. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      By this stage in the process, youâ€™re likely to have established channels of dialogue with key stakeholders. You should use these to share information as and when needed. For example, this could be in a regular public meeting or posting progress updates on your website.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You will have checked each site's availability and achievability during the previous stage of the process.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This phase builds on that work and allows you to make sure nothing has changed. You also have the chance to build resilience through further assessment iterations if needed.  
                    </p>

                      This process will give you a clearer picture of the most appropriate sites. It will also allow you to refine your criteria to do a more detailed assessment where needed.

                    <p>
                      For a more detailed assessment, you should consider:

                        lead times, delivery rates and market capacity

                    <p>
                      This includes considering the capacity, type and development mix of your current sites.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You should also draw on your whole planâ€™s viability study. It will give you a complete picture of how each site meets your needs. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You should test your candidate sites on a settlement or sub-area scale.
                    </p>

                    <p>Test your sites by recording:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        why it is appropriate - including how it meets your local need and spatial strategy

                    <p>
                      As well as your preferred candidate sites, you should show where you have tested any alternatives earlier in the process.

                    <p>
                      Considering alternative sites will also feed into your plan's environmental assessment. You can follow separate guidance for more detail on this.

                    <p>
                      The number of sites you allocate depends on your spatial strategy. There are several things to reconsider if, after several iterations, you do not have enough. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Among other things, this could include (in no order of priority): 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        how you selected sites in this stage - are there any more that would meet your plan vision? 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        how you assessed sites in Stage 2 - could you change the mitigation criteria and local considerations used?  
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        the assumptions you made around density and development potential - are they right?  
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        the reasonable alternatives to your spatial strategy, and whether you could do further assessment of these 
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      As per the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/2-achieving-sustainable-development#:~:text=11.%20Plans%20and%20decisions%20should%20apply%20a%20presumption%20in%20favour%20of%20sustainable%20development.">National Planning Policy Framework</a>, plans and decisions should apply a presumption in favour of sustainable development. If you still do not have appropriate capacity within your proposed sites, you need to explain why and how the plan allows for sustainable development in your justification.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This will form part of your examination criteria and will directly affect whether the sites element of your plan is considered sound. You will also need to then explore other options to meet any needs somewhere else. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You may find that you have more suitable sites than you need to meet your development needs. These sites may also be similar in terms of their deliverability, developability etc. Applying your planning judgement to the process, you may decide not to allocate some of those similar sites and instead choose ones that better meet your plan vision. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It's fine to choose between similar sites using your planning judgement, but make sure you clearly document the reasons for your choices.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You can find more detail on all these approaches in the previous guidance stages.
