                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Categorising your sites will help inform your spatial
                        strategy, as this will give you a good view of what you
                        can build based on the available sites.&nbsp;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It will also highlight what other types of evidence you
                        need to be able to assess and allocate your sites. This
                        will differ depending on your area.&nbsp;
                      </p>
                      <h3 id="how-you-could-categorise-sites">
                        How you could categorise sites
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Categorising sites involves different ways to assess the
                        type of land on a site and what it’s possible to build
                        there.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You could use this initial step to split your sites
                        into:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>greenfield-led housing sites</li>
                        <li>brownfield-led housing sites</li>
                        <li>employment-led sites</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        This could be useful to do at the start, but is
                        something you may do at another point in your
                        assessment.&nbsp;
                      </p>

                        Greenfield-led sites are sites where the leading
                        development is on land not previously built on.&nbsp;

                      <p>
                        If your site is mixed-use, it would be considered a
                        housing-led site if housing is the main driver for the
                        development with some supporting employment uses.
                        Employment sites are sites where the main use is
                        employment, with some other uses, such as co-located
                        housing or retail. If you have a site that you’re using
                        for housing and employment that aren’t interlinked, you
                        should split the site and submit as two separate sites.

                        availability of sites you have. You can categorise your
                        sites in a way that works for your circumstances. You

                        Once you’ve identified and categorised your sites, you
                        could carry out an initial sift of your sites. You
                        should look at things that could be major constraints.
                        These are constraints that mean it might not be suitable
                        land to build on.&nbsp;

                      <p>
                        If any of your sites are affected by these constraints,
                        you should ideally discard those sites first, as they
                        are the hardest to mitigate. This will be different
                        depending on the area and some of these constraints
                        might not stop you from taking your sites forward into a
                        detailed assessment. You should use your judgement based
                        on your local area and the sites you have
                        available.&nbsp;

                        constraints mean you cannot develop on the site. If you

                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        There are lots of options for how you might score your
                        sites to help you decide which you take forward to the
                        next stage and which you discard. You should avoid using
                        a complex, weighted approach.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Our preferred approach is the Red, Amber, Green (RAG)
                        approach. This uses a simple system to score sites.

                      <p>
                        The Red, Amber, Green (RAG) approach is where you’d give
                        each site a colour coded scoring depending on how
                        suitable it is. We’ve created some examples to show how
                        this could work.

                      <p>
                        You need to decide whether developing in a conservation
                        area would cause substantial harm.<br />
                        &nbsp;<br />
                        <strong>Red</strong> - likely substantial harm<br />
                        <strong>Amber</strong> - mitigation is possible<br />
                        <strong>Green</strong> - no substantial harm would be
                        caused, any minor harm mitigated
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At the end of this suitability assessment, you should
                        look at whether part of a site could be used with less
                        constraints.

                        You need to assess whether a site has suitable access.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Red</strong> - not safely achievable<br />
                        <strong>Amber</strong> - constrained access<br />
                        <strong>Green</strong> - suitable existing access or new
                        access is achievable

                      <p>
                        This approach should help you create your categories and
                        add RAG scoring to each site based on the constraints it
                        has. Once you’ve done this, you’ll need to balance out
                        the constraints with mitigation for each site. This will
                        help you decide which sites you take forward to draft
                        allocation. You can use your own process for this based
                        on your local context.

                        You should have information from the call for sites to
                        check the availability of a site. It should be
                        considered available if the landowner or promoter has
                        said they intend to build on the site or sell it for
                        development, and there are no legal constraints.&nbsp;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Sites that might be considered unavailable include sites
                        with:
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        You should include timescales for availability in your

                        unknown.&nbsp;

                      <p>
                        The achievability of a site is assessed based on if it
                        can be built on at a particular point in time and if it
                        is likely to be viable. You should carry out an initial
                        viability study reviewing the sites at a high-level
                        using typologies or a sample of sites. This will help
                        highlight if your preferred spatial strategy is
                        achievable.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You should consider any sites with a typology that is
                        unviable to be potentially unachievable at this stage. A
                        whole plan viability study at a later stage will check
                        the viability of specific sites and any policy
                        requirements your plan might need to consider.
